**Introduction** 

Recently, Galaxy has been providing workflows that allow one to
pre-define the order in which tools are applied to input files and
intermittently generated files to achieve a certain goal. These
workflows can be edited by and shared among users. Workflows can help
to simplify the relatively complex process of creating a gene finding
system that consists of many different steps. In order to run a
workflow, one only needs to specify the few input arguments and as a
result obtains, for instance, the gene predictions as well as
intermediate results allowing detailed inspection.

We provide two basic workflows:

* **mGene Prediction** uses a pretrained mGene predictor as well
  as a FASTA file with genomic sequences as input and performs genome-wide gene
  predictions.

* **mGene Training** uses a FASTA file with genomic sequences and a
  (partial) annotation of these sequences in GFF3 format in
  order to train the signal, content, and gene predictors and to perform
  genome-wide gene predictions.

**Examples**

**Example 1: Using a pre-trained model to predict genes from DNA sequence**

As a simple example we will use the provided data from *Caenorhabditis
elegans* to predict genes. This task will only require a FASTA
file containing the genomic sequence. We will use some annotated genes
in a GFF3 file merely to compare them with the results of our
predictions and to estimate the performance accuracy. The following
tools are needed (they can be selected from the list on the left-hand
side):

* **Examples and Instructions:** Choose "Caenorhabditis elegans (small
  part of chromosome II)" from the selection menu at the top of this
  page and press Execute. Three files will be uploaded and are added
  to the current history on the right-hand side: the Genome Sequence
  (FASTA), the Genome Annotation (GFF3), and a text file containing
  some information on the data.

* **mGenePredict:** To start generating gene predictions select "From
  current history" as *Source of genome sequence* then make sure that
  the Example Data FASTA file is selected as *Genomic sequence*. As
  *Predictor source* choose "Pretrained predictor", then pick
  "Caenorhabditis elegans" as *organism* and press
  Execute. It will take up to 45 minutes until the result file "mGene Gene
  predictions in GFF3 format" will be ready in your history panel.

* **mGeneEval:** This tool is used to compare the obtained gene
  predictions against a known annotation. Select the "Example Data:
  Genome Annotation in GFF3 form" as *Label file* and the "mGene Gene predictions in
  GFF3 format" as *Gene predictions*. As *Genomic sequence* select the
  Example Data FASTA file and as *Option* "Only consider regions around
  annotated genes". As a result an extensive accuracy report is
  generated and stored as text file.


To run predictions on your own data, use the "Upload file" tool to
upload a FASTA file from your computer and continue with mGenePredict.

**Example 2:  Training a new model and applying it to predict unknown genes from DNA sequence**

We are currently applying our system to a variety of other
organisms. (Please check the list in the mGenePredict Tool). However
if we do not (yet) provide a pre-trained model for your organism of
interest, you have the possibility to train the system yourself. In
this case you will need a FASTA file with the genomic sequence and
additionally a GFF3 file containing some annotated, e.i. known genes. To
elucidate the process along the lines of an example we will again use
the provided data from *Caenorhabditis elegans*. The following tools are
applied:

* **Examples and Instructions:** Choose "Caenorhabditis elegans (small
  part of chromosome II)" from the selection menu at the top of this
  page and press Execute. Three files will be uploaded and are added
  to the current history on the right-hand side: the Genome Sequence
  (FASTA), the Genome Annotation (GFF3), and a text file containing
  some information on the data.

* **mGeneTrain:** Select the FASTA file as *Genomic sequence* and the
  GFF3 file as *Set of known genes*. Press Execute and have some
  patience. Training a model to detect genes is not a simple task and
  can take some time. The output will be the internal data structure
  TmGP (Trained mGene Predictor). It can be used with mGenePredict to
  predict genes.

* **mGenePredict:** To start generating gene predictions select "From
  current history" as *Source of genome sequence* then make sure that
  the FASTA file is selected as genomic sequence. As *Predictor source*
  choose "Predictor from current history", pick the TmGP file generated
  by the mGeneTrain tool, then press Execute.  

* **mGeneEval:** You can again compare the generated predictions with
  the annotation file (See Example 1). Note that if you use the same
  GFF3 label file for evaluation that you have previously used to run
  mGeneTrain the reproted errors are training errors. To estimate
  the true performance of your predictor you need a different set of
  annotated genes that have not been used for training.


For training on your own data you need to upload a FASTA file with the
DNA sequence and additionally a corresponding GFF3 file with at least
a few annotated genes. You can then continue with the mGeneTrain tool
on these files.

**About formats**



**FASTA format** A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line
description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line
is distinguished from the sequence data by a "greater than" (>) symbol
in the first column. The token until the first space or the end of the 
line is used as an identifier for the sequence. The remainder of the 
description line is ignored.

An example sequence in FASTA format is:

>CHR1

**GFF3 format** General Feature Format is a format for describing genes
and other features associated with DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. GFF
lines have nine tab-separated fields:

    1. seqname - The name of the chromosome or scaffold (e.g., chr1, chrY_random).
    2. source - The program that generated this feature.
    3. feature - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are "CDS", "start_codon", "stop_codon", and "exon".
    4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. (The first base on a chromosome is numbered 1.)
    5. end - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).
    6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter ".".
    7. strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
    8. frame - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0 and 2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.
    9. group - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.

For more information see http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml


**TmGP format** Trained mGene Predictor is an internal structure that
contains the complete trained model including all signal and content
predictors as well as the gene predictor to predict genes from
sequence.
