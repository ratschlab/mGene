**Introduction**

This is the software package mGene for genomewide prediction of protein
coding genes from DNA sequences. It implements the ideas presented in
[1]. The high accuracy of our system was shown in the gene finder
competition nGASP on nematode genomes [2].  

In the following we will provide some general instructions on how to use
the mGene tools mgene_train, mgene_predict, and mgene_eval. These tools
are mainly addressed to researchers who wish to quickly obtain a gene
annotation for their sequence of interest. For researchers who are also
interested in individual components of mGene, like splice site or
promoter predictions, we recommend to have a look at the additionally
provided mGene Modules. These might also be of interest for
computational biologist that work on DNA sequence prediction tasks.

If you have addiotional questions on mGene, please write an email to
support@mgene.org.

**Examples**

**Example 1: Using a pre-trained model to predict genes from DNA sequence**

As a simple example we will use the provided data (see subdirectory
./examples) from *Caenorhabditis elegans* to predict genes. This task
will only require a FASTA file containing the genomic sequence. We will
use some annotated genes in a GFF3 file merely to compare them with the
results of our predictions and to estimate the performance accuracy. The
following tools are needed:

* **mgene_predict:** To start generating gene predictions run the
  following command

  ./bin/mgene_predict examples/elegans.fasta "Caenorhabditis elegans" elegans-prediction.gff3 

  It will take up to 45 minutes until the result file elegans.gff3 will
  be available in the current directory. 

* **mgene_eval:** This tool is used to compare the obtained gene
  predictions against a known annotation. Run

  ./bin/mgene_eval examples/elegans.gff3 elegans-prediction.gff3 elegans-evaluation.txt

  As a result an extensive accuracy report is generated and stored in
  elegans-evaluation.txt as text file.


**Example 2:  Training a new model and applying it to predict unknown genes from DNA sequence**

We are currently applying our system to a variety of other
organisms. However if we do not (yet) provide a pre-trained model for
your organism of interest, you have the possibility to train the system
yourself. In this case you will need a FASTA file with the genomic
sequence and additionally a GFF3 file containing some annotated,
i.e. known genes. To elucidate the process along the lines of an example
we will again use the provided data from *Caenorhabditis elegans*. The
following tools are applied:

* **mgene_train:** To train mGene on the C. elegans toy data run:

  ./bin/mgene_predict examples/elegans.fasta examples/elegans.gff3 "wormbase"   

  Training a model to detect genes is not a simple task and can take
  quite some time. The output will be the internal data structure TmGP
  (Trained mGene Predictor). It can be used with mgene_predict to
  predict genes.

For training on your own data you need to upload a FASTA file with the
DNA sequence and additionally a corresponding GFF3 file with at least
a few annotated genes. You can then continue with the mgene_train tool
on these files.

**About formats**



**FASTA format** A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line
description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line
is distinguished from the sequence data by a "greater than" (>) symbol
in the first column. The token until the first space or the end of the 
line is used as an identifier for the sequence. The remainder of the 
description line is ignored.

An example sequence in FASTA format is:

>CHR1

**GFF3 format** General Feature Format is a format for describing genes
and other features associated with DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. GFF
lines have nine tab-separated fields:

    1. seqname - The name of the chromosome or scaffold (e.g., chr1, chrY_random).
    2. source - The program that generated this feature.
    3. feature - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are "CDS", "start_codon", "stop_codon", and "exon".
    4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. (The first base on a chromosome is numbered 1.)
    5. end - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).
    6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter ".".
    7. strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
    8. frame - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0 and 2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.
    9. group - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.

**TmGP format** Trained mGene Predictor is an internal structure that
contains the complete trained model including all signal and content
predictors as well as the gene predictor to predict genes from
sequence.
