To setup mGene follow the these steps:

1. Goto ./mex and run make ('make octave' for Octave and 'make matlab' for
   Matlab)

2. Download and compile Shogun toolbox from
   http://www.shogun-toolbox.org, copy resulting .mex (matlab) or .oct
   (octave) file and all libraries in ./shogun

3. Download and compile Shogun toolbox version 0.6.7 from
   http://www.shogun-toolbox.org, copy resulting .mex (matlab) or .oct
   (octave) file in ./shogun-0.6.7

   Please note: We currently need this version due to a bug introduced in
   Shogun version 0.7 that has not been fixed yet (will be in one of the
   next next releases). This only affects the tool mgene_signal_predict.

4. Run ./setup_mgene.sh and setup paths and configuration options 
   for mGene.

Optional
5. Customize subsampling settings in src/subsample_policy.m
6. If SGE Gridengine support is enable, customize the scheduling policy in src/rproc_policy.m and src/rproc_memtime_policy.m.

Try to run ./run_example1.sh and ./run_example2.sh to check whether
you installation is working.
